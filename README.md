# End-to-End-Heart-Disease-Classification
Model Overview
This model leverages logistic regression, a well-established machine learning algorithm for binary classification tasks. The goal is to predict the presence or absence of heart disease based on a set of medical and demographic features. The logistic regression algorithm estimates the probability of a patient having heart disease, which is then converted into binary predictions.
